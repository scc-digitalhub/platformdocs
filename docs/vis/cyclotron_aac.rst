AAC Integration
===============

Authentication Methods
----------------------

The forked version of Cyclotron supports OAuth2/OpenID as login method, via *implicit flow*. The module is usable 
with any *OAuth2/OIDC-compliant* identity provider, but some advanced functionalities such as role mapping and 
permission evaluators are available only when using **AAC** as IdP.

On Cyclotron **web app**, login can be performed:

- via LDAP by providing username and password
- via OAuth2/OpenID, i.e., being redirected to an identity provider (e.g. AAC) for authentication

On Cyclotron **API**, requests can be authenticated:

- via session key, which is the internal mechanism used by Cyclotron web app to authenticate its requests to the API
- via ``Authentication`` HTTP header
- via API key

The Authentication header must provide a valid token issued by the IdP. It is used by the web app if login is performed 
via OAuth2/OpenID and can be used to request API services directly:

::

   GET /dashboards/mydashboard HTTP/1.1
   Host: localhost:8077
   Accept: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <my_token>

The API key is issued by IdP and can be passed as query parameter in the URL to request API services:

::

   http://localhost:8077/dashboards/mydashboard?apikey=<my_apikey>

Authentication Configuration with OAuth2
----------------------------------------
Remember to set the same configuration (when needed) to both backend and frontend, without exposing private variables.

Frontend Configuration
**********************
Open ``cyclotron-site/_public/js/conf/configService.js`` and set the following properties under ``authentication``:

.. code:: javascript

    authentication: {
      enable: true,
      authProvider: 'aac',
      authorizationURL: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/eauth/authorize',
      clientID: '<clientID>',
      callbackDomain: 'http://localhost:8088',
      scopes: 'openid profile user.roles.me'
    }

Backend Configuration
*********************
Open ``cyclotron-svc/config/config.js`` and update the properties according to your needs:

.. code:: javascript

    enableAuth: true,
    authProvider: 'aac',
    oauth: {
        useJWT: <true|false>,
        clientId: '<clientId>',
        clientSecret: '<clientSecret>',
        jwksEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/jwk',
        tokenIntrospectionEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/oauth/introspect',
        userProfileEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/userinfo',
        parentSpace: 'components/cyclotron',
        editorRoles: ['ROLE_PROVIDER','ROLE_EDITOR']
    }

In order to use **JWTs** as bearer tokens, and locally verify them, please set ``useJWT:true`` and provide only one 
of these two configurations:

- populate ``jwksEndpoint`` with the JWKS uri to use public/private key verification via RSA
- set ``clientSecret`` and leave ``jwksEndpoint`` empty to use simmetric HMAC with clientSecret as key

Examples:

.. code:: javascript

    //JWT + public RSA key
    oauth: {
        useJWT: true,
        clientId: '<clientId>',
        clientSecret: '',
        jwksEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/jwk',
        tokenIntrospectionEndpoint: '',
        userProfileEndpoint: '',
    },

    //JWT + private HMAC key
    oauth: {
        useJWT: true,
        clientId: '<clientId>',
        clientSecret: '<clientSecret>',
        jwksEndpoint: '',
        tokenIntrospectionEndpoint: '',
        userProfileEndpoint: '',
    },

Do note that the default validation will check for a valid signature and for the correspondence between ``clientId`` and ``audience``. 
If you want to also validate the *issuer* of JWT tokens set the corresponding property in config:

.. code:: javascript

    oauth: {
        issuer: <issuer>
    }

Alternatively, you can use **opaque tokens** as bearer, and thus leverage *OAuth2 introspection* plus *OpenID userProfile*. 
This configuration requires ``useJWT:false`` and all the endpoints properly populated (except ``jwksEndpoint``).

Example:

.. code:: javascript

    //opaque oauth
    oauth: {
        useJWT: false,
        clientId: '<clientId>',
        clientSecret: '<clientSecret>',
        jwksEndpoint: '',
        tokenIntrospectionEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/oauth/introspect',
        userProfileEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8080/aac/userinfo',
    },

Role mapping
************
By default, valid users are given the permission to create and manage their own dashboards, but can not access private 
dashboards without a proper role. A dashboard is private if the ability to **view** and/or **edit** it is restricted 
to specific users or *groups*.

Cyclotron supports two different roles:
- ``viewers``
- ``editors``

When using an external IdP (such as AAC) it is possible to map **roles** and **groups** by defining a context 
for the component space and a mapping for the **editor** role (i.e. a list of external roles that must be mapped 
as **editor** role in Cyclotron):

.. code:: javascript

    oauth: {
        parentSpace: 'components/cyclotron',
        editorRoles: ['ROLE_PROVIDER','ROLE_EDITOR']
    },

As such, Cyclotron dynamically assigns roles to users at login, by deriving their **group memberships** and their role 
inside such groups from the IdP user profile. Any role that is not included in ``editorRoles`` will be mapped as **viewer**.

By setting ``parentSpace`` we define a prefix for roles obtained from the IdP, which is then used to derive the group 
from the following pattern:

::

    <parentSpace>/<groupName>:<roleName>

For example, the upstream role ``components/cyclotron/testgroup:ROLE_PROVIDER`` with the given configuration can be translated to:

- (``parentSpace=components/cyclotron``)
- ``group=testgroup``
- ``role=editor``

because the upstream ``ROLE_PROVIDER`` role is recognized as an editor role.

The upstream role ``components/cyclotron/testgroup:ROLE_USER`` will be translated to:

- (``parentSpace=components/cyclotron``)
- ``group=testgroup``
- ``role=viewer``

Without a direct mapping to a given group, the system won't assign any role to the current user in such group. 
The user won't thus be able to access any dashboard restricted to that group.

Client Application Configuration on AAC
---------------------------------------

Log in to AAC as a provider user and click "New App" to create a client application. In the Settings tab:

- add Cyclotron website as redirect URL: ``http://localhost:8088/,http://localhost:8088`` (change the domain if it runs on a different host and port)
- check all the Grant Types and at least ``internal`` as identity provider (this must be approved on the Admin account under tab Admin -> IdP Approvals)

In the API Access tab:

- under OpenID Connect, check ``openid``
- under User Profile Service, check ``profile.basicprofile.me`` to give access to user profiles to the client app
- under Role Service, check ``user.roles.me`` to give access to user roles

You can find ``clientId`` and ``clientSecret`` properties in the Overview tab. Add ``clientId`` to 
``cyclotron-site/_public/js/conf/configService.js`` and ``cyclotron-svc/config/config.js``. Add ``clientSecret`` as well if needed.

Now you can (re)start Cyclotron API and website with authentication enabled. Most services will now be protected 
and will require login and specific privileges.

**NOTE**: if you need to change the API port you can do it in the configuration file, but changing Cyclotron website port 
can only be done in ``cyclotron-site/gulpfile.coffee``, inside the Gulp task named ``webserver`` (line 281): 
update ``port`` and ``open`` properties as needed.

Using Cyclotron API
-------------------

AAC Roles and Cyclotron Permissions
***********************************

**NOTE**: refer to AAC documentation on its Data Model if you are not familiar with the concepts of "role" and "space".

If you use AAC as authentication provider, then Cyclotron *groups* correspond to AAC *spaces*. By default, owners 
of a space in AAC have the role ``ROLE_PROVIDER``. In the AAC console, in the tab User Roles, owners (providers) 
of a space can add other users to it and assign them roles.

Suppose you configured ``oauth.editorRoles=['ROLE_PROVIDER','ROLE_EDITOR']`` and the following AAC roles exist:

- user A is provider of space T1 and user of space T2:

::

    components/cyclotron/T1:ROLE_PROVIDER
    components/cyclotron/T2:ROLE_USER

- user B is user of space T1:

::

    components/cyclotron/T1:ROLE_USER

- user C is editor of space T1:

::

    components/cyclotron/T1:ROLE_EDITOR

When these users log in to Cyclotron via AAC they are assigned the following property:

- user A: ``memberOf: ['T1_viewers', 'T1_editors', 'T2_viewers']``
- user B: ``memberOf: ['T1_viewers']``
- user C: ``memberOf: ['T1_viewers', 'T1_editors']``

**NOTE**: editors can also view, i.e., users A and C being members of T1_editors are also members of T1_viewers; 
but viewers cannot edit, i.e., groups *<group_name>_viewers* cannot be assigned as editors of a dashboard.

Creating Private and Public Dashboards
**************************************

When authentication is enabled, if a dashboard has no editors or viewers specified when it is created, by default 
both edit and view permissions are restricted to the dashboard creator only, who is allowed to change this behaviour 
later on. In order to allow anyone to view a dashboard, even anonymously, its view permissions can be given to the 
system role **Public**. Edit permissions can be given to **Public** as well, in which case the dashboard is editable by every user.

If you want to restrict access to a dashboard, you can give view/edit permissions either to specific users or 
to groups you are a member of. Some examples are provided in the next section.

Restricting Access to Dashboards in JSON
****************************************

If you create a dashboard as a JSON document (either by POSTing it on the API or via JSON document editor on the website), 
this is its skeleton:

::

   {
       "tags": [],
       "name": "foo",
       "dashboard": {
           "name": "foo",
           "pages": [],
           "sidebar": {
               "showDashboardSidebar": true
           }
       },
       "editors": [],
       "viewers": []
   }

Resuming the example above, suppose user A wants to restrict access to its dashboard:

- dashboard editors list: can contain only group **T1_editors** or its members (e.g. user C)
- dashboard viewers list: can contain groups **T1_viewers** (*not* T1_editors as it is already a subset of T1_viewers, since editors are automatically also viewers) and **T2_viewers** or their members (e.g. users B and C)

Each editor or viewer specified in the lists must have three mandatory properties: ``category`` (either "User" or "Group"), 
``displayName`` (used for readability purpose) and ``dn`` (unique name that identifies the user or group; corresponds 
to ``distinguishedName`` property in Cyclotron API User model).

Example 1. User A restricts edit permissions to themselves and gives view permissions to group T2:

::

   "editors": [{
       "category": "User",
       "displayName": "John Doe",
       "dn": "A"
   }],
   "viewers": [{
       "category": "Group",
       "displayName": "T2",
       "dn": "T2_viewers"
   }]

Example 2. User A restricts both edit and view permissions to group T2, i.e., every T2 member can view but only editor members can edit:

::

   "editors": [{
       "category": "Group",
       "displayName": "T2",
       "dn": "T2_editors"
   }],
   "viewers": [{
       "category": "Group",
       "displayName": "T2",
       "dn": "T2_viewers"
   }]

In short: use *<group_name>_editors* syntax for editors and *<group_name>_viewers* syntax for viewers.

**NOTE**: the system role **Public** is represented by the following properties:

::

    {
        "category": "System",
        "displayName": "Public",
        "dn": "_public"
    }

Testing
*******

If you want to test the authorization mechanism (e.g. on Postman), you can use the following URLs, setting the ``Authorization`` header with an appropriate token:

- to create a dashboard, POST on ``http://localhost:8077/dashboards``
- to update a dashboard, PUT on ``http://localhost:8077/dashboards/{dashboard_name}``
- to retrieve a dashboard, GET on ``http://localhost:8077/dashboards/{dashboard_name}``
